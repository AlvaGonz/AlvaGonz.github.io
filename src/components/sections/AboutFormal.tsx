          <p>
            I am an evolving Full-Stack Developer, transitioning from a strong Frontend foundation toward a deeper focus on Backend Architecture and System Design. While I navigate the balance between these worlds, I am actively exploring QA Automation, Data Analysis, and Cybersecurity to broaden my technical horizons.
          </p>
          <p>
            My philosophy is grounded in writing clean, maintainable code and—more importantly—understanding the "why" behind every technical decision. However, I believe the role of a developer is fundamentally changing.

            As we move from manual implementation to AI-powered orchestration, I adopt a management-first mindset. I view modern development not just as coding, but as leading a team of AI agents. By focusing on architecture and effectively delegating tasks between human creativity and AI execution, I aim to build scalable, high-impact solutions that were previously out of reach for a solo practitioner. For me, leveraging this "digital workforce" is no longer optional—it is the essential skill for productivity and success in 2026 and beyond.
