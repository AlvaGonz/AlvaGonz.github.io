          <p>
            I am a Software Engineering student transitioning from a Frontend foundation toward a
            deeper focus on Backend Architecture and System Design. While I navigate the balance
            between these worlds, I find myself increasingly drawn to backend development.
            Concurrently, I am exploring QA Automation, Data Analysis, and Cybersecurity to broaden
            my technical expertise.

            My development philosophy centers on writing clean, maintainable code and understanding
            the "why" behind every technical decision. I believe the role of a software engineer is
            fundamentally evolving in the age of AI-assisted development.

            As the industry shifts from manual implementation to AI-powered orchestration, I embrace
            a management-first mindset. I view modern development not merely as coding, but as
            architecting solutions and orchestrating AI agents as a digital workforce. By
            strategically delegating tasks between human creativity and AI execution, I aim to build
            scalable, high-impact systems that were previously beyond the reach of individual
            practitioners. Mastering this paradigm is essential for success in 2026 and beyond.
