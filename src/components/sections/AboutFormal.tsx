          <p>
            I'm a full-stack developer with deep expertise in frontend development,
            now specializing in backend architecture and system design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently exploring QA automation, data analysis, and cybersecurity
            as potential specializations to focus on next.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in writing clean code, understanding the "why" behind
            technical decisions, and continuously learning new technologies.
